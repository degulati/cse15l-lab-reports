## This is my second markdown page 

Markdown is versatile. It allows us to *italicize* and **bold** text within a document that is accessible across any OS and supported by many applications.

Here is a link to my [CSE 15L Website](https://github.com/degulati/cse15l-lab-reports/).

In this lab, we learned to use various commands at the command line, such as
```
ls
cd
pwd
```

We can also create bulleted lists:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
